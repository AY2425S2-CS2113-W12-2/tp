### Enhancements Implemented
#### Canteen Feature
The Canteen feature acts as the central hub for canteen-related functionalities, 
delegating tasks to sub-features like Canteen Finder and Lookup. 

It uses a command-driven interface (`startCanteen`) to handle user inputs.
The modular design separates concerns into distinct classes, ensuring scalability. 
OOP principles like encapsulation and single responsibility were applied, 
with each class focusing on specific tasks.

#### Canteen Finder Feature
The Canteen Finder helps users locate the nearest canteen matching their criteria (e.g. halal certified, vegetarian). 

It uses `Landmark` and `Canteen` classes to model locations and canteens, with `StallCharacteristic` encapsulating stall attributes. 
OOP techniques like composition and data validation ensure flexibility and robustness. The hierarchical structure mirrors real-world relationships, 
making the system intuitive and extensible.

#### Canteen Lookup Feature
The Canteen Lookup allows users to explore stalls in specific canteens. 

A mapping system (`CanteenShortcuts`) standardises shorthand inputs (e.g., "te" â†’ "Techno Edge"). 
Detailed stall information is displayed using clear, structured outputs. Abstraction and efficient data structures enhance modularity and performance. 
Error handling ensures a smooth user experience when invalid inputs are provided.
